## Provok.in - Issues

This is the *issues* repository for the [Provok.in][pvk] website. Please use the [issues][] tab at the top to log a problem with the website. Use the search box on the issues page to look for an existing issue describing the same problem, otherwise click on `New Issue` to log the problem.

When creating an issue, please try to be as specific as possible - especially useful are these details:

*    Browser name and **version** (e.g.: `Internet Explorer 8`, `Chrome 18`, etc.)
*    Type of device (e.g.: `iPhone 4S`, `Macbook`, `HP Desktop`, etc.)
*    Name and **version** of the device's operating system (e.g.: `Windows XP`, `Android 3.0`, etc.)
*    Sequence of actions leading to the problem (e.g.: navigate to `such URL`, click on `such button`, etc.)
*    Whether or not the problem is **repeatable** (doing the same sequence of actions on the same device and browser always triggers the error)

Keep in mind that a problem that is *not* repeatable may be due to quite a few outside factors (internet provider, Provok.in host temporary issue, etc.).

Thanks!
Martin
